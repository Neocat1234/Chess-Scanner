# Chess-Scanner

## Using Azure API services, takes a copy of a written, notated, chess game, (pdf format), scans it and returns the game with the result (who won)

Using Azure's Document Analysis API and the help of various AI models, I wrote a program in python to scan and return the result of chess games in chesslife magazine, as well as a list of the moves played, and who played it. 

## Project is Incomplete

I ran into issues with the quality of the older magazines, and had problems recognizing the match clearly, and since older games were written using different notation compared to modern games, the image quality effected the outcome of the code, leading to the output being incorrect.
